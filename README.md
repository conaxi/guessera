# Guessera

A geographic game for people with all sort of knowledge about Geography.

## The point of this

Geography doesn't have to be boring. At school, geography might be the most boring subjects out of others. Instead of something interactive, we read books and looking at maps, forcing us to remember locations and countries. This project is made to help people learn geography easier, in a fun and interactive way. When we learning, our experience matters most, it also affects how brain remember things. Opposite of reading books and studying boring geography in school which makes geography have a bad reputation.
